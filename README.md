# üß™ panel-chemistry

The purpose of the `panel-chemistry` project is to make it really easy for you üë®‚Äçüî¨ to do exploratory Data Analysis üìà and build powerful data and viz tools üõ†Ô∏è within the domain of Chemistry ‚öóÔ∏è.

## üí° Background

THIS PROJECT IS JUST STARTING (2021-05-19) AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN AN IDEA. It was started by the discussion [How to display JSME molecular editor with Panel?](https://discourse.holoviz.org/t/how-to-display-jsme-molecular-editor-with-panel/2306/12) in the [Panel Community Forum](https://discourse.holoviz.org/)

The structure of the project will be the same as the [panel-highcharts](https://github.com/marcskovmadsen/panel-highcharts) project and package until something else is decided. I.e. we use

- [binder](https://mybinder.org/) to provide an easy to use environment for trying, learning, exploring and using the packing. [See MarcSkovMadsen/../binder](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/panel-chemistry/tree/main/binder).
- Python [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to easily run build, test etc tasks. [See MarcSkovMadsen/../tasks](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/panel-chemistry/tree/main/tasks)
  - This includes includes running isort, autoflake, black, pylint, mypy and pytest and making sure all test should pass before merging to main branch. This will keep the code and package working and maintainable.
- Provide documentation via this README and an examples folder of notebooks. [See MarcSkovMadsen/../examples](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/panel-chemistry/tree/main/examples)

Maybe we also improve it further

- Add CI/ CD on Github to build, test and deploy the package. (I have not tried this before)
- Add various badges (I have not tried this before).
- Add documentation on read the docs. But not for now in order to keep things simple.

## üèÉ Getting Started

`pip install panel_chemistry`

```python
import panel_chemistry as pc
import panel as pn

pn.extension("jsme", sizing_mode="stretch_width)

editor = pc.JSMEEditor(height=800)
editor
```
